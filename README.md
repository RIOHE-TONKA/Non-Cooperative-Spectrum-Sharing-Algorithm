# Non-Cooperative-Spectrum-Sharing-Algorithm
This project focuses on the design of a noncooperative spectrum sharing algorithm using game theory and cognitive radio networks. It simulates PU-SU competition, prioritizing PUs while SUs opportunistically access spectrum. Evaluated using Jain's Fairness Index in Python.
